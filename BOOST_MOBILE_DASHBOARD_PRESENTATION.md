## **SLIDE 1: TITLE SLIDE**
### "Boost Mobile Command Center: Real-Time Business Intelligence for Colorado Franchise Network"

**Speaker Notes:**
"Good morning, everyone. Today I'm excited to present the Boost Mobile Command Center - a revolutionary dashboard that transforms how we manage and optimize our 50 Colorado franchise locations. This isn't just another analytics tool - it's your business cockpit for making data-driven decisions in real-time."

---

## **SLIDE 2: THE CHALLENGE**
### "What Franchise Owners Face Daily"

**Key Points:**
- 📊 **Limited Visibility**: Can't see performance across all 50 locations in real-time
- 💡 **Missed Opportunities**: Sales opportunities slip through the cracks
- ⚔️ **Competitive Pressure**: Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile eating market share
- 📱 **Customer Insights**: Don't know what devices/plans customers really want
- 💰 **Revenue Optimization**: Can't identify top-performing strategies to replicate

**Speaker Notes:**
"Our franchise owners are running blind. They manage multiple locations but can't see the full picture. When a customer in Denver mentions switching from Verizon, how do we ensure every store knows the best counter-strategy? When iPhone 16 is hot in Colorado Springs, how quickly can we adjust inventory and promotions network-wide?"

---

## **SLIDE 3: THE SOLUTION OVERVIEW**
### "Introducing the Boost Mobile Command Center"

**Key Features:**
- 🚀 **Live Command Center**: Real-time metrics updating every 5 seconds
- 🏪 **Store Performance**: Geographic analytics across all Colorado locations  
- 📊 **Customer Intelligence**: AI-powered conversation analysis
- ⚔️ **Competitive Intelligence**: Track competitor mentions and responses
- 💬 **Sales Opportunities**: Identify high-value prospects in real-time

**Speaker Notes:**
"The Command Center gives you superpowers. Imagine walking into any meeting and knowing exactly what's happening across your network RIGHT NOW. Not yesterday's numbers, not last week's report - live data that helps you make decisions in the moment."

## **SLIDE 4: LIVE DEMO - COMMAND CENTER**
### "Real-Time Network Performance"

**Key Metrics to Highlight:**
- 💰 **$362,105 Total Network Revenue**
- 📱 **444 Devices Sold Today** across 29 active stores
- ⭐ **4.46/5.0 Customer Satisfaction** 
- 🎯 **Live Alerts**: Hot leads, trending devices, competitor price matches

**Speaker Notes:**
"This is your mission control. Right now, I can see we've generated over $362,000 in revenue today across our Colorado network. That pulsing green light means our data is live - updating every 5 seconds. See that alert? A customer in Denver just asked about a family plan for 5 lines. That's a $125/month opportunity that would have been invisible before."

## **SLIDE 5: STORE PERFORMANCE INTELLIGENCE**
### "Geographic Business Intelligence"

**Screenshot: Store Performance Map Tab**

**Key Insights:**
- 🏆 **Top Performing Stores**: Ranked by revenue with conversion rates
- 📍 **City-Level Analytics**: Performance by Denver, Colorado Springs, Boulder
- 📈 **Conversion Tracking**: Visitor-to-customer ratios by location
- 📱 **Device Popularity**: What's selling where across Colorado

**Speaker Notes:**
"This view transforms how you think about your business. Instead of wondering which stores are performing, you SEE it instantly. Look at this - your Colorado Springs location is converting 43% of visitors to customers. That's exceptional! We can now study what they're doing right and replicate those strategies across underperforming locations."

## **SLIDE 6: CUSTOMER INTELLIGENCE**
### "Know Your Customers Like Never Before"

**Screenshot: Customer Analytics Tab showing conversation data**

**Customer Insights:**
- 👥 **27 Customer Conversations Analyzed**
- 🛍️ **15 Customers with Buying Intent** (sales opportunities!)
- ⚔️ **3 Competitor Mentions** tracked (Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile)
- 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 **5 Family Plan Inquiries** (high-value opportunities)

**Real Examples:**
- "John switching from Verizon" - High price sensitivity, iPhone 16 interest
- "Ashley TikTok Creator" - Buying iPhone 16 Pro for content creation
- "Mike T-Mobile user" - Family plan interest, switching from competitor

**Speaker Notes:**
"This is where the magic happens. Every customer conversation is analyzed by AI to extract business intelligence. We're not just tracking sales - we're understanding customer psychology. When someone mentions T-Mobile is 'too expensive for my family of 4,' our system flags that as a competitive opportunity and suggests our family plan pricing advantage."

---

## **SLIDE 7: COMPETITIVE INTELLIGENCE**
### "Stay Ahead of the Competition"

**Key Competitive Insights:**
- 📊 **Market Share Tracking**: Boost Mobile vs major carriers

- ✅ **38% savings** compared to AT&T  
- ✅ **35% cost reduction** vs T-Mobile
- ✅ **Same network coverage** at fraction of the cost

**Speaker Notes:**
"Knowledge is power in this business. When a customer walks in and says 'Verizon quoted me $120/month,' your staff instantly knows we can beat that by 45% - and the system shows them exactly how to position that advantage. We're not just cheaper - we're strategically smarter."
